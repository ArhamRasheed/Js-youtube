/*
Explanation of the Program:
1. Initialization
* The program defines an array of size 1,000,000 and fills it with random integers between 0 and 999.
* It uses 4 threads to process the array in parallel.
2. Multi-threaded Sum Calculation
* The array is divided into 4 equal parts, and each thread computes the sum of one part.
* Each thread runs the function sum_array(), which calculates the sum for its portion.
* The results from each thread are returned as void*, which is then typecast back to long.
3. Aggregating the Results
* The pthread_join() function ensures that the main thread waits for all worker threads to complete.
* After collecting the partial sums, the main thread adds them together to get the total sum.
4. Output
* The program prints the total sum of all array elements.
* The actual output will vary depending on the random values generated.
* This approach improves performance by parallelizing the computation, making it significantly faster than a single-threaded approach when working with large datasets.
